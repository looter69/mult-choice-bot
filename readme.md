# Multiple Choice Bot
A simple program that allows Users to input a list of questions and corresponding answers. The program will pick and ask a random question and checks if the User's input is correct.

## Features
1. Read custom List of Questions
2. Picking Question at Random
3. (Randomising response options)

## To add Questions
For each Question-Answer-Combo:
```
[Q] : [A1] : [A2] : [A3] : [A4] : i : j

Q = Question
A1-A4 = Possible responses (1-4 of which are correct)
i = Indices of the correct response (1-4)
j = How many times a Question has to be answered correctly before it's removed from the List

```
Save your Question list as ```Questions.txt```!

### Important
- Make sure none of your Questions or Answers contain the ```:``` symbol. This is used as a formatting character!
- If parsing a Question fails, you will find the corresponding Line mentioned in your console output.
